# mlem_simulator

Simple simulation of the Mlem: Space Agency game. https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/387378/mlem-space-agency 
Simulation traverses the game are trying to max out the dices (as in prefers to keep them over launching as far as possible, then uses them as good it can)
Very simple statistical analysis, just to see where are the "hotspots" of the actual game. 
Probably can be easily updated with some machine learning bot to try to max out the points rather than distance (will require additional logic for cat deployment at planets and data about moons' and planets' in-game points)
